A choropleth map showing the standardized stroke ratios (SSR) for each town region, using the ICAR model adjusting for age (65+), sex, hypertension and diabetes. In this map, since different town regions differ in population size (ranging from less than a thousand to over half a million people in each town region), we combined smaller town regions such that each region in the map contained at least 10,000 people.
